			<h1>Training with my brother</h1>
			<p>
				So here I am ready to run even longer distances, with some good pace and the most important thing i.e. support from by brother. My brother registerd for a 21K trail run in Kanatal, Uttrakhand at an altitude of 2590m and asked me about weather I would like to register for a 10K run, and I was like "Hell Yeah Let's do this" so he also made the registration for me.
			</p>
			<p>
				The race was on 29th June and we had almost 50 days to train for it. Me and my brother made a proper training plan with weekly easy runs, tempo runs, long runs. I was also trying to cope up with him but wasn't able to so I foccused on my capabilities and strengths and tried to move on. It was really a pleasent time training with my brother, he helping me out and in return I helping out it really was a fun time, and I learnt a lot of things in this period which helped me become a better athlete.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as we know nothing always go as you planned it to be, and as were reaching closer to race day our trip was also closer of getting cancelled due my dad's health, I understood the situation and accepted it though I wasn't able to run the race I did get more healthier and stronger.
