			<h3>How it started?</h3>
			<p>From 2017 to 2018 I gained a total of 25 kgs, --><!--  and at that time I weighed 100 kgs. So I decided that now it's time to change. And I was also 2 months away to get into a college and thus it was the perfect motivation for me to get into shape. Thus I joined a gym mainly focusing on cardio and diet and doing my work strictly and honestly I started seeing the changes, though they were not physical but still I was loosing about 1-2 kgs a week. At that time I realised that if you do your job with complete honesty you will see the change. I continued the gym for about 5 weeks and lost a total a 9 kgs, that brought a huge change in me but still <span>I was very far from being fit</span>. I continued with my diet and played soccer in college. But it didn't help me as I was overweight and all those soccer drills were just making me injury prone, at that time I didn't realised it but all those crampful nights made me realised it. So I stopped playing soccer and was help from my brother(who is also a runner), and he too told me the samething. So as a solutiion to it he asked me to start running and I also took it seriously. It was 1st December 2018 my last exam of 1st semester and so I decided to start running from 2nd December 2018. --><!-- </p>

I thought that it is very easy 4-5 kms and I can do it very easily, I had no idea about my pace, my cadence nothing, I was just running and there I go after 500m all drained out so I walked a few metres and then sprinted my way through, again walked and sprinted this went for a total of 1.73kms and then I stopped. I was disappointed, disheartened and felt baffled, and thought I was never going to make it, I would never be fit again. But next evening I again went for it, but the result was same no change , I covered 1.86 kms. Next day was also the same.</p>
			<p>The next day I said to myself "I have to live my whole life like this a 88 kg boy who was worthless" and I <span>stopped</span> running. --> <!-- </p> -->

			<h3>Getting back at it</h3>
			<p>For two months I didn't did any --> <!-- running just played soccer in college, knowing the consequences it can have on my overweighted body. But after the annual sports fest of the college, I was determined to again start running and never quitting or even stopping it.</p>
			<p> With only one goal in mind though you run slow, you have to run long, you need cover those miles, you will not stop until you had done what you have decided for the day. I was going good and in the span of 5 weeks I was able to cover a total of 88 kms, in which I even ran many many 5k runs and my longest run of 6km. --><!-- </p>
		</div>
		<div class="row row-content">
			<h3>Training with my brother</h3>
			<p>
				So here I am ready to run even longer --> <!-- distances, with good pace and also support from by brother. My brother registerd for a 21K trail run in Kanatal, Uttrakhand at an altitude of 2590m and asked me about weather I would like to register for a 10K run, and I was like "Hell Yeah Let's do this" so he also made the registration for me.
			</p>
			<p>
				The race was on 29th June and we had almost 50 days to train for it. Me and my brother made a proper training plan weekly with easy runs, tempo runs, long runs. I was also trying to cope up with him but wasn't able to so I foccused on my capabilities and strengths and tried to move on. It was really a pleasent time training with my brother, he helping me out and in return I helping out it really was a fun time, and I learnt a lot of things in this period which helped me become a better athlete.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as we know nothing always go as you planned it to be, and as were reaching closer to race day our trip was also closer of getting cancelled due my dad's health, I understood the situation and accepted it though I wasn't able to run the race I did get more healthier and stronger. -->
			<!-- </p>

		<div class="row row-content">
			<h3>Bhavuk Runs 365</h3>
			<p>
				As I wasn't able to run that trail run so --> <!-- I was eager to do something special.
				So I decided that I will run for each and every day for 365 days for atleat 10 mins. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On 29 July 2019 I took a pledge to myself to run for every single day for a year. First few days were difficult, thinking of the routine of waking up early every morning, doing warm-up, go for a run, get ready for college- classes and labs, study, sleep early made me mad and I started thinking that I would not able to it. But then my brother told me about this athlete Eluid Kipchoge who is greatest marathon runner runner of all time, he had won 11 out of his 12 marathons, world record holder, and thing what I liked about him was his idealogy he believes in <span>"No Human Is Limited"</span> and he says that it is your mind who makes you do things, you just need to control it and you will be able to do everything what you want to do.
				This inspired me and I went on to run for every single day. Days, weeks, monthts passed I was going great, I woke up early every morning followed my routine and things were going well, I was feeling fine, some days I felt some cramps but foam rolling and massages were there to help me out through these days. And I was quite motivated to do what I had decided, then on 12th October Eluid Kipchoge became the first person to run a marathon under 2 hours(1:59:40), I was like yes I will run for every single day for a year and no one can stop me from doing that. -->
				<!-- I was running nice, my form was looking good and days were passing by and I was feeling good. -->
				
			<!-- </p>

			<div class="row row-content">
				<h3>Something unexpected happened</h3>
				<p>
					On 22 October my brother messaged me asked  --><!-- me that he will help me run my first sub 30 min 5K on on my 90th day of this running streak which was on 26 October. And I was like YES LETS DO IT.
				So I recovered the whole week from 23 October to 25 October.
				Me and my brother were coming home from college and job respectively for Diwali and we were so excited to achieve this 5K mark, do some long runs together and enjoy.
				</p>
				<p>
				And I reached Kota(hometown) completely relaxed and recovered on 25th October and then something happened which I never expected I felt some fever that night so I took some medicine and milk and went to sleep. But the morning of my 90th day wasn't like I wanted it to be, the fever was still there. So I decided to shift my plan to 27 october and just did a light run on my 90th of running streak today thus I went for a run but just after 1.2kms my right knee was paining badly. But I forgot that thought and ran 2.2 kms with my bro.
				After the run my brother did some stretching for me and I was fine, now came the I was waiting for last 7–8 days. It was a cold sunday morning and my body was paining like hell I couldn't even move and inside me I was thinking that I have lost everything my 5k record, my 365 day streak everything. And then after sometime the realization came that I have chicken pox and I said no way and that was it I wasn't able to run from my 91st day and thus my streak endend.
				</p>
				
				<p><strong><span>THINGS I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS SITUATION:</span></strong></p>
				<ol>
				<li>You need to learn to accept the situation.</li>
				<li>I win or I learn I never fail. You must try to LEARN TO LEARN.</li>
				<li>Sometimes it is better to look back in past and see what you have achieved, it will help you feel better. Like in my situation I looked back and saw that I ran for 90 days regularly whatever may be the condition and it helped me feel better.</li>
				<li>Your body is like a vehicle if you are using it you need to refuel it. This was my major mistake I ran, I worked hard, I used my body to full extent but didn't gave it back the fuel to recover.</li>
				</ol> -->
				
				<!-- This time before coming home for Diwali holidays I was so excited to enjoy the festival with the family but nobody can stand before god's decision and my thus my Diwali didn't went the way I wanted it to be.
				This is how my 5 day Diwali break was extended to 10, my parents helped me a lot towards my fast recovery otherwise these 10 day could have easily been converted to 15 or 16. There were times when I was just sitting on my bed and getting everything like food, water, fruits, milk I mean everything, really a big thanks to my parents for all this. Though this break helped my body to recover a lot but on the other hand there will be a lot of academic load on me from now onwards. -->
				<!-- <p>
				At that time my next aim was to train for my first 10K race on 22nd December in Pune. -->
				<!-- </p>

			<div class="row row-content">
				<h3>My first 10K race</h3>
				<p>
					22 December 2019, my first 10 K race. --> <!-- I was quite excited for the race from the day my brother registered for it. Me and my brother woke up at 3:30 in the morning on 22nd and were up and ready by 4:15 to leave for Shree Shivchhatrapati Sports Complex, Pune where the race was supposed to start.
					</p>
					<p>
					I was feeling nice and was quite motivated to complete the race in under 60 mins, as I was suffering from piriformis syndrome from the past 3–4 weeks and at last now I was able to recover from the pain and that too on my own. We reached the sports complex at 5:10, yeah it was a long ride. The flag-of time for the race was at 6:00, so we did some warm-up, streches and were ready to run. My brother actually registered for the half marathon but since he was suffering from some knee pain from past 3 weeks he decided to not to run the 21k distance rather he decided to pace me for my race.
				</p>
				<p>
					We were all set standing on starting line all warmed up and ready to run. We decided to run the first 7 kms at a pace of 6:20 and then pace up for the last three kms. It was very congested for first 1–1.5 kms as there were around 7–8 thousand runners taking part in the 10K race. We were running good and were able to maintain our pace(6:20) for first 7 kms and it was time to pace up but I wasn’t ready for that so I said my brother “I wouldn’t be able to pace up right now let’s pace up at 8kms”.

					So I ran 8th kilometre at a pace of 5:40, and at this moment to achieve my goal I was required to run the last two kilometres at a pace of 5mins per kilometre, and it was really tough for me as my quads per paining a lot and wasn’t able to take deep breaths and thus I wasn’t able to achieve my goal, my chip time was 1:04:58, though it was my 10K personal best.
				</p>
				<p>
					My brother helped me a lot to achieve this time all thanks to him as I was just running behind him without thinking of anything else. Thank you bro for everything.

					I was satisfied with my performance but I learnt that I have to train a lot harder to achieve my goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We(me and my brother) have a long road to travel and we will not stop until we achieve our goals and dreams. -->
				<!-- </p>

				<h3>My 10K Personel Best</h3>
				<p>
					After my first 10K race I was confident of myself --><!--  that I can run a better time, with training, exercise and proper care of my body.
					So I decided to run another 10K at Jaipur Marathon on 2nd Feb, but this I had less time(2-3 weeks) to train for it as planned my run at last moment.
					But that didn't afraid I did my training propoerly ate healthy and was ready for the race. I left from the college the night before the raceday to my maternal grandmother(nani)'s home as my college is outside the city.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was time for another 4 AM alarm , and I was ready by 5:00 and left for Albert Hall, Jaipur where was supposed to start, it was a cold, and was still dark and I was unable find any cab or moto so I walked to Albert Hall it was about 2.5 kms. I reached there at 5:30, did some warm-up and was ready to for the kick-off. 
						This time I tried to maintain my pace from the starting of race, though it was congested but I raced my way through I was going great, properly breathing, taking to myself telling not to push hard just maintain the 6:15 pace. 
						And I completed half way  mark in 30:44 Avg.Pace 6:09, then I said to myself that now you are not going down from now there is only one way that is going forward. I maintained my pace 6:04 at 7.5 km mark(45:31) then I thought that now my goal is to cover 2.5kms in 14 mins and that's it. Ipushed myself but fall 2 mins 26 secs short of my sub 60 min 10K.
					</p>
					<p>
						But I wasn't disappointed with such a short duration of training I was able to pull out such a great time. -->
