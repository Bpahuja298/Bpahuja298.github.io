			<h1>How it started?</h1>
			<p>From 2017 to 2018 I gained a total of 25 kgs, and at that time I weighed 100 kgs. So I decided that now it's time to change. And I was also 2 months away to get into a college and thus it was the perfect motivation for me to get into shape. Thus I joined a gym mainly focusing on cardio and diet and doing my work strictly and honestly I started seeing the changes, though they were not physical but still I was loosing about 1-2 kgs a week. At that time I realised that if you do your job with complete honesty you will see the change. I continued the gym for about 5 weeks and lost a total a 9 kgs, that brought a huge change in me but still <span>I was very far from being fit</span>. I continued with my diet and played soccer in college. But it didn't help me as I was overweight and all those soccer drills were just making me injury prone, at that time I didn't realised it but all those crampful nights made me realised it. So I stopped playing soccer and was help from my brother(who is also a runner), and he too told me the samething. So as a solutiion to it he asked me to start running and I also took it seriously. It was 1st December 2018 my last exam of 1st semester and so I decided to start running from 2nd December 2018.</p>
